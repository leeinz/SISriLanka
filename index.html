                <p> Little Sri Lanka is nestled in the north-east corner of Staten Island. While its area is small, The Sri Lankans occupying this neighborhood are now rumored to be more than one third of the entire Sri Lankan population in New York City as well as being the largest home for Sri Lankan people outside of Sri Lanka. </p>
                <p> The reason for the concentration of Sri Lankan people on Staten Island is largely due to a man named Leslie Gunaratne. When he moved to Staten Island in 1967, he was the first Sri Lankan person to reside on Staten Island. In only a few months, he assisted his siblings and their families in their immigration endeavors. By the time Mr. Gunaratne moved to Houston, he estimated that 80% of the Sri Lankan's on Staten Island were related to him via blood or marriage. </p>
