        <h1>What is "Sri Lankan" food?</h1> <img class="food" id="cuisine" src="Images/srilankacuisine.jpg"> <img class="food" id="Colombo" src="Images/ColomboStreetFood.JPG"> <img class="food" id="tamil" src="Images/SriLankanTamilFood.jpg"> </center>

        <p>Many people who are unfamiliar with Sri Lankan food seem to ask if it is similar to that of its neighboring India. Naturally, countries who share borders tend to have some overlap in terms of culture and food, but Sri Lankan food has a personality all its own.</p>
        <p>Sri Lankan food has a varied flavor profile: sweet caramelized onion relishes, bitter melons, spicy scraped coconut, thin curries, and samosas. Additionally, due to its history with European colonization and international trade moving through the island, many non-native ingredients and themes are included in the island nation's cuisine.</p>
        <p>As with so many other Asian nations, rice serves as the base for most meals. The term "rice and curry" is synonymous for food in general. A typical meal contains rice, a curry with a thin broth, chunks of protein (beef, pork, fish, goat, etc.) plus an assortment of side dishes (anywhere between four to ten, depending on the time and place.)</p>
        <p>If time is of the essence, most Sri Lankan people enjoy "short eats," or snacks. The phrase "short eats" stems from the cocktail-party like fare Europeans would consume in the evening. Today, short eats encompass a variety of different foods such as beef croquettes, <em>kotthu roti,</em> spicy chickpeas served in paper cones, and samosas with meat & vegetable filling.</p>
        <p>You can find many of the delicacies and snacks at the following restaurants and markets on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Three of the five establishments are clustered together on Victory Boulevard, which is a 20 minute walk from the Staten Island ferry. If you are traveling by bus, these locations are accessible via the S62 and other north-shore bus lines.</p>
